## Goal
In this project, a prediction model has been built to predict whether a movie is going to perform well on the platform based on the information in the dataset

## Challenge
The key challenge in this project is the investigation of missing data, deciding whether these data are informative or non-informative missings.
Filling informative missing data with mean or median would be problematic. For example, a customer record with a missing contract cancellation date means that this customer's contract has not been cancelled yet. You can't say this registered customer has cancelled the service.
